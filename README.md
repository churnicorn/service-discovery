# service-discovery
Service discovery prototypes.

Originally intended to quickly prototype with Consul and Smartstack to see how they would fit in Lifesum's existing stack. Check out Smartstack for detailed steps and a walkthrough on getting is setup and exploring its features.

We found that there wasn't anything else out there that was quite as clear and beginner friendly and we hope these steps will help someone completely new to this get started.
